## üí° Inspiration

Navigating the vast sea of online products can feel like finding a needle in a haystack, especially without the guidance of a knowledgeable sales representative. My friend and I know this struggle all too well ‚Äî the hesitation, the uncertainty, the fear of missing out. That's why we created Square Edge: a game-changing integration designed to empower Square sellers and elevate the shopping experience on their Square Online Store. Picture this: virtual sales rooms that not only streamline decision-making for customers but also forge meaningful connections between sellers and potential buyers. Our mission? To bridge the gap between your products and your customers, ensuring that every purchase decision is informed, confident, and satisfying.

## üß© Challenges we ran into

Finding a way to properly integrate a third party application to the Snippet's API was a little challenging, but once we go the format down, it was good to go. We also had trouble with authenticate Square with our application, but with some resources from the Discord channel, we were able to figure it our rather quickly. Finding a way to map the virtual sales room to the Square online store was challenging as well, but with careful inspection of the DOM, we were able to find a clever workaround that did the trick.

## üéâ Accomplishments that we're proud of

Given the one moneth time constraint, we‚Äôre able to create this full-stack application from scratch to solve a real world problem that really hasn't been implemented yet, which is something we're extremely proud of.
